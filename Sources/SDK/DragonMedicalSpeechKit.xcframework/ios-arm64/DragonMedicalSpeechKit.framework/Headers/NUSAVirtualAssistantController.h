/**
 @brief Opens DMVA for the specified grammar model.
 
 Opens DMVA for the specified grammar model. If the SpeechKit session isn't open, the application type isn't correct, the DMVA state is invalid, or the parameter value is invalid, the request won't be processed and VAResultCode value is returned. Otherwise, DMVA will continue to asynchronously validate the user license and initialize for the specified grammar model. The state will be set to Opening and VAResultCodeSuccess is returned. DMVA will transition to the Opened state when it has successfully completed license and grammar checks.
 
 The return value is one of the following:
 
 NUSAVirtualAssistantErrorCodeNoError - openWithModel has been initiated successfully and DMVA is in the Opening state.
 
 NUSAVirtualAssistantErrorCodeApplicationStateError - The application is in a state which doesn't allow an Open process to commence (either Opening or Closing).

/** @brief Uploads concept values for a dynamic concept.
 
 Asynchronously sets the list of literal-value pairs for a dynamic concept.  The specified concept will be overwritten with the contents of the new list for the current user.  This is meant to be used right after the Virtual Assistant has opened so that the items in the concept are available for all the transactions. Note: The command call returns a status synchronously, but the upload and processing by the DMVA server is asynchronous. The registered NUSAVirtualAssistantControllerDelegate's uploadConceptResult method will be called when the upload has occurred. Items will persist in DMVA after it has closed and will be available for the current user in subsequent sessions until clearUploadedValuesForConcept is called. Therefore, if it isn't expected that the items will be valid beyond the current session, we recommend you call clearUploadedValuesForConcept before closing the DMVA session. If you need to update a concept for immediate use, use setInlineValuesForConcept instead. If DMVA isn't open, the request isn't processed and false is returned.

Use clearInlineValuesForConcept to clear the concept when the items are no longer needed, or the items will continue to be available until DMVA closes.
