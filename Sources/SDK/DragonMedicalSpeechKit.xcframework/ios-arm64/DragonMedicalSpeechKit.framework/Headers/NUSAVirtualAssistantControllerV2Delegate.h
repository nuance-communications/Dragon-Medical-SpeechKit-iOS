/** @brief DMVA controller delegate.
 
 This delegate is used for all callbacks to the Dragon Medical Virtual Assistant (DMVA) client. It is registered with the NUSAVirtualAssistantControllerV2 instance. All the methods in the delegate are optional.*/

/** @brief Handles DMVA events.
 
 Notifies the integrator of different events received from DMVA after a request has been processed. For example, the user says "Hey Dragon, show me CBC". On recognizing the wake word, the SDK sends the begin speech audio to its response and gets the vaActive event from DMVA, which it passes to the integrator. When the DMVA command is processed on the DMVA server, vaComplete along with a JSON response is received from DMVA, which is passed to the integrator using this delegate method.
 
 @param event An object describing the event, including the event type and a result message.
