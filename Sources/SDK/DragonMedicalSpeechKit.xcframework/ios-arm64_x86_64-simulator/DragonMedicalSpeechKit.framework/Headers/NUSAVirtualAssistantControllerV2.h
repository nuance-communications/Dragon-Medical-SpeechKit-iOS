/**
 @brief Opens DMVA for the specified grammar model.
 
 Opens DMVA for the specified grammar model. If the SpeechKit session isn't open, the application type isn't correct, the DMVA state is invalid, or the parameter value is invalid, the request will not be processed and VAResultCode value is returned. Otherwise, DMVA will continue to asynchronously validate the user license and initialize for the specified grammar model. The state will be set to Opening and VAResultCodeSuccess is returned. DMVA will transition to the Opened state when it has successfully completed license and grammar checks.
 
 The return value is one of the following:
 
 VAResultCodeSuccess - openVA has been initiated successfully and DMVA is in the Opening state.
 
 VAResultCodeNoSessionError - The request can't be processed because the session isn't initialised.
 
 VAResultCodeApplicationStateError - The application is in a state which doesn't allow an Open process to commence (either Opening or Closing).
 
 VAResultCodeBadRequestError - A bad request to the server. For example, model is null or an empty string, or doesn't start with one of "Administrator", "Physician", or "Nurse".
 
 VAResultCodeInternalSDKError - The process threw an unexpected exception.
 
@param model The name of the grammar model to load.

 Closes DMVA and frees up resources. DMVA will continue the closing process asynchronously and will transition to the Closed state when it has finished closing. If DMVA is already in the Closing state, the request won't be processed and VAResultCodeApplicationStateError is returned. Once closeVA is called, you'll need to call openVA again to use DMVA.
 
 The return value is one of the following:
 
 VAResultCodeSuccess - closeVA has completed successfully and DMVA has transitioned into the Closed state.
