## Speech-enabling your app
To activate speech recognition, you will need licensing information in the form of a partner GUID and an organization token; your integration passes these parameters to Dragon Medical SpeechKit when initializing a session. Once your registration at https://www.nuance.com/healthcare/developers.html is approved, you will receive licenses for a 90-day evaluation period. You will also have access to the SDK documentation, support forums and other resources to help you optimize your integration for production usage.
