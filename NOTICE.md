This document includes licensing information relating to free, open-source, and public-source software (together, the “SOFTWARE”) included with or used while developing Nuance’s Dragon Medical SpeechKit iOS. The terms of the applicable free, open-source, and public-source licenses (each an “OSS LICENSE”) govern Nuance’s distribution and your use of the SOFTWARE. Nuance and the third-party authors, licensors, and distributors of the SOFTWARE disclaim all warranties and liability arising from all use and distribution of the SOFTWARE. To the extent the OSS is provided under an agreement with Nuance that differs from the applicable OSS LICENSE, those terms are offered by Nuance alone.

Nuance has reproduced below copyright and other licensing notices appearing within the SOFTWARE. While Nuance seeks to provide complete and accurate copyright and licensing information for each SOFTWARE package, Nuance does not represent or warrant that the following information is complete, correct, or error-free. SOFTWARE recipients are encouraged to (a) investigate the identified SOFTWARE packages to confirm the accuracy of the licensing information provided herein and (b) notify Nuance of any inaccuracies or errors found in this document so that Nuance may update this document accordingly.

Certain OSS LICENSES (such as the GNU General Public Licenses, GNU Library/Lesser General Public Licenses, Affero General Public Licenses, Mozilla Public Licenses, Common Development and Distribution Licenses, Common Public License, and Eclipse Public License) require that the source code corresponding to distributed OSS binaries be made available to recipients or other requestors under the terms of the same OSS LICENSE. Recipients or requestors who would like to receive a copy of such corresponding source code should submit a request to Nuance by post at:

Copyright-Only Dedication (based on United States law) or Public Domain Certification

The person or persons who have associated work with this document (the "Dedicator" or "Certifier") hereby either (a) certifies that, to the best of his knowledge, the work of authorship identified is in the public domain of the country from which the work is published, or (b) hereby dedicates whatever copyright the dedicators holds in the work of authorship identified below (the "Work") to the public domain. A certifier, moreover, dedicates any copyright interest he may have in the associated work, and for these purposes, is described as a "dedicator" below.

A certifier has taken reasonable steps to verify the copyright status of this work. Certifier recognizes that his good faith efforts may not shield him from liability if in fact the work certified is not in the public domain.

Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and to the detriment of the Dedicator's heirs and successors. Dedicator intends this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and future rights under copyright law, whether vested or contingent, in the Work. Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of all rights includes the relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those copyrights in the Work.

Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified, built upon, or otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and in any way, including by methods that have not yet been invented or conceived.
